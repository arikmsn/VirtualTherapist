## 📋 How It Works

### Phase 1: Therapist Learning (Onboarding)

The AI learns your personal style through a 5-step onboarding:

1. **Therapeutic Approach** - CBT, psychodynamic, etc.
2. **Writing Style** - Tone, length, terminology
3. **Summary Preferences** - Sections, format, templates
4. **Communication Style** - Follow-up frequency, preferred exercises
5. **Learning Examples** - Your actual summaries and messages

### Phase 2: Fully Personalized Agent

Once onboarding is complete, you get an AI that:

```
✅ Speaks exactly like you
✅ Uses your preferred terminology
✅ Matches your therapeutic approach
✅ Signs messages with your name
✅ Maintains your style consistently
```

**Example Message:**

```
NOT: "Good morning, I am artificial intelligence..."
YES: "Hi Sarah, this is Dr. Cohen. How was your week?"
```

---

## 🔐 Security & Privacy (CRITICAL!)

### Ironclad Rules

```
⚠️ NEVER store data outside encrypted Israel/EU servers
⚠️ ALL patient data encrypted end-to-end (AES-256)
⚠️ THERAPIST MUST approve every message to patients
⚠️ FULL audit log of every action
⚠️ GDPR compliant with full deletion capability
⚠️ NO data sharing with 3rd parties
```

### Compliance

- ✅ **GDPR Compliant** - Right to access, deletion, portability
- ✅ **End-to-End Encryption** - AES-256 for all sensitive data
- ✅ **Complete Audit Trail** - Every action logged
- ✅ **Data Residency** - Israel/EU servers only
- ✅ **No Third-Party Sharing** - Your data stays yours

---

## 🎭 Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Session Summary

```
1. Therapist ends session
2. Clicks "📝 Write Summary"
3. Records 2 minutes OR types notes
4. AI generates structured summary in therapist's style:
   - Topics discussed
   - Interventions used
   - Patient progress
   - Homework assigned
   - Next session plan
5. Therapist edits (30 seconds)
6. Clicks "💾 Save"
7. ✓ Done!
```

**Time saved:** ~10-15 minutes per session

### Workflow 2: Patient Follow-up

```
1. AI detects: "Patient hasn't completed homework"
2. AI creates draft message in therapist's voice:
   "Hi Yossi, this is Dr. Cohen. How did the breathing
   exercise go? Anything new come up?"
3. Therapist sees notification
4. Reviews message → Can edit or approve
5. Therapist approves
6. Message sent to patient
7. ✓ Therapeutic continuity maintained
```

**Result:** Patients stay engaged between sessions

## ⚖️ Ethical Boundaries

### What the AI Does

✅ Assists with documentation
✅ Drafts messages for therapist approval
✅ Maintains therapeutic continuity
✅ Speaks in therapist's voice (with permission)

### What the AI NEVER Does

❌ Acts autonomously with patients
❌ Provides diagnoses
❌ Recommends medications
❌ Handles crisis situations
❌ Replaces human therapist

**The AI is an assistant, not a replacement.**

---

## 🎯 Measurable Goals

- **Therapist:** Save 1.5 hours weekly on documentation
- **Patient:** Maintain momentum between sessions
- **Business:** 30% Freemium → Paid conversion
- **Quality:** NPS ≥ 8/10 from therapists
